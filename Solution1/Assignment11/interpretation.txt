When comparing M. tuberculosis and H. sapiens Chr. 08,
one of the things of note is the difference in CG content:
it's higher than 65% in M. tuberculosis and just shy of 40% in H. sapiens Chr. 08.
This difference also speaks to the high thermic resilience of the M. tuberculosis genome,
which maintains its integrity even after extended exposure to a heat shock.

From a cursory look, it seems that CTAG is a target of DNA methylation,
which is more predominant as a mechanism for gene regulation in eukaryotes,
which could explain why the fold change is much, much lower in M. tuberculosis.

CG as a sequence could be linked to CpG islands,
which are especially significant in gene regulation through methylation,
where the methylated C may in turn mutate into a T,
possibly leading to the depletion of CG sequences outside CpG islands in eukaryotes.

AACCCTGTC when translated into an amino acid sequence could be read as NPV (Asn-Pro-Val) or DRV (Asp-Arg-Val).
DRV is also the beginning sequence in angiotensinogen, the precursor to various angiotensines,
which are important when it comes to how tight (or tense) blood vessels are,
thereby regulating blood pressure, which is quite important in humans (hence possibly the extremely high fold change),
but much less so in M. tuberculosis.

ATG in DNA becomes AUG in RNA, which is the start triplet for building peptide polymers in living organisms.
