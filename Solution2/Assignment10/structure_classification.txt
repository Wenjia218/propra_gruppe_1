1MBN: 6 helices in a knot
SCOP
> Class a: All alpha proteins

> (core: 6 helices; folded leaf, partly opened)
CATH

1BAF: 2 domains with many sheets, kind of sandwich-like
SCOP

> Fold b.1: Immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich
> (sandwich; 7 strancs in 2 sheets; greek-key)
> (some members of the fold have additional strands)
CATH

> Topology/fold 2.60.40: Immunoglobulin-like

1TIM: 2 domains with alpha/beta barrels
SCOP
> Class c: Alpha and beta proteins (a/b)
> Fold c.1: TIM beta/alpha-barrel

256b: 2 x 4 helix bundles
SCOP
> Class a: All alpha proteins
> Fold a.24: Four-helical up-and-down bundle
> (core: 4 helices; bundle, closed or partly opened, left-handed twist; up-and-down)
CATH
> Class 1: Mainly Alpha
> Architecture 1.20: Up-down Bundle
> Topology/fold 1.20.120: Four Helix Bundle (Hemerythrin (Met), subunit A)

Overall both systems net fairly similar classifications for Class and Folds,
even if they're called Topology per the CATH acronym.
Personally I found CATH easier to use with the extra Architecture layer between Class and Fold (or Topology),
whereas with SCOP the enormous list of Folds in each Class was a bit overwhelming.
