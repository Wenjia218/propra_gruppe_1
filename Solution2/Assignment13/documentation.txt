Documentation for Bowtie Assignment13:

First I ran the script from Assignment 10 Solution 1 for every file in genome_files and saved them as fasta files

Next I ran the script from Assignment 13 from Solution 1 for every fasta that was created previously

Then I ran the bowtie script on the bioclient1 server and used following flags:

-v 3 alignment for aligning with up to 3 mismatches
-S for SAM as output file type
-f file to set the fasta input file
-a to align all reads


and ran this for every file in the hg19 genome sequence

so the command looked like this: (e.g.)

python3 /mnt/biocluster/praktikum/bioprakt/Software/bowtie-1.2.2/bowtie /mnt/biocluster/praktikum/bioprakt/Software/bowtie-1.2.2/indexes/hg19/bt -v 3 -S -f -a Helicobact_Erkennungssequenzen.fasta Helicobact.SAM
