I used two different inputs as dataset

The first one is the sequence of TP53 tumor protein p53

I chose this as the first input, as it was the first output when searching Human Genom Recources from NCBI
with the inputs "homo sapiens" and "cervical infections" which is a disease related to the given organism "Mycoplasma genitalium"
Then I used blastp to create the tables in output1

the second input is the sequence of methionine sulfoxide reductase A

I chose this as the second input, as it was a result when searching with the inputs "homo sapiens" and "Myoplasma genitalium" on the
same website
With input2 I chose the same procedure as with output2

The second input has more hits than the first, which makes sense, because one parameter of my search in HGR was the given organism name
